/**
 * Thinking level mapping for Ollama Cloud models.
 *
 * Maps Pi's thinking levels to Ollama Cloud's OpenAI-compatible
 * `reasoning_effort` values. The API accepts "none", "low", "medium",
 * "high", and "max". On simple prompts, "max" can be a no-op over
 * "high", but on harder prompts it can increase thinking substantially
 * (e.g. deepseek-v4-pro: ~32k tokens on high vs ~55k on max).
 *
 * A `null` value means the level is hidden in Pi's UI.
 *
 * Model-specific behavior discovered through testing (see docs/think-experiment.md):
 *   - Most models: all levels work, "none" disables thinking
 *   - GPT-OSS: no off mode, only low/medium/high
 *   - Qwen 3.x (non-VL): binary-only (think/nothink) - off works
 *   - Qwen 3 VL: "none" doesn't disable thinking - off is hidden
 *   - GLM 5.2: off/high/max are exposed; low/medium are hidden
 *   - Kimi K2 Thinking: "none" doesn't disable thinking - off is hidden
 *   - MiniMax M2.x: "none" doesn't disable thinking - off is hidden
 *
