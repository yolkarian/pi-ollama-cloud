# pi-ollama-cloud

Ollama Cloud provider plugin for the [Pi](https://pi.dev) coding agent.

Registers Ollama Cloud as a model provider with dynamically fetched models, and provides `ollama_web_search` and `ollama_web_fetch` tools that use the [Ollama Cloud web search API](https://docs.ollama.com/capabilities/web-search) - no local Ollama server required.

## Features

- **Dynamic model discovery** - Fetches the full model list from `ollama.com/v1/models`, then fetches per-model details via `/api/show` to determine capabilities, context length, and tool support.
- **Data-driven thinking levels** - Maps Pi's thinking levels to Ollama Cloud's OpenAI-compatible `reasoning_effort` values via `thinking-levels.ts`, sourced from models.dev per-model reasoning options with a small override table for the models where `none` doesn't disable thinking.
- **Baked-in model list** - A generated fallback list (`models.generated.ts`) ships with the extension so models are available on first launch without any network calls. It is only a fallback: pi refreshes the live catalog at runtime, so shipping a new release for catalog freshness is no longer needed.
- **Automatic model refresh** - On startup, `/model` open, and `pi update --models`, pi calls the extension's `refreshModels` callback to fetch the latest models from the API and persists them through pi's own model store. No manual refresh command.
- **`ollama_web_search` tool** - Search the web for real-time information using Ollama Cloud's `/api/web_search` endpoint. Returns titles, URLs, and content snippets.
- **`ollama_web_fetch` tool** - Fetch and extract text content from a web page URL using Ollama Cloud's `/api/web_fetch` endpoint. Returns page title, content, and links.
- **Per-token cost tracking** - Models are registered with the official per-token prices from [ollama.com/pricing](https://ollama.com/pricing), so Pi's `/cost` shows comparable usage. Ollama Cloud is subscription-billed, so these are equivalent pay-as-you-go rates, not actual charges.

## Prerequisites

- An [Ollama Cloud API key](https://ollama.com)

## Installation

### Option 1: from npm (recommended)

```bash
pi install npm:pi-ollama-cloud
```

This installs the latest published version from npm. Run `pi update` to get new versions.

### Option 2: from git

```bash
pi install git:github.com/fgrehm/pi-ollama-cloud
```

This clones the repo to `~/.pi/agent/git/` and adds it to your settings.

For project-local install (stored in `.pi/git/`):

```bash
pi install git:github.com/fgrehm/pi-ollama-cloud --local
```

### Option 3: `-e` flag (try without installing)

```bash
pi -e npm:pi-ollama-cloud
```

### Option 4: Clone manually (if you want to make changes and "try it live")

Pi auto-discovers subdirectories under `~/.pi/agent/extensions/`:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:fgrehm/pi-ollama-cloud.git ~/.pi/agent/extensions/pi-ollama-cloud
```

## Setup

### 1. Get an API key

Sign up at [ollama.com](https://ollama.com) and generate an API key.

### 2. Configure the API key

The simplest way is the `/login` command inside Pi: run `/login`, choose **Use an API key**, pick **Ollama Cloud**, and paste your key. Pi stores it in `~/.pi/agent/auth.json` and `/logout` removes it.

Alternatively, set the `OLLAMA_API_KEY` environment variable:

```bash
export OLLAMA_API_KEY="your-key"
```

Or add it to `~/.pi/agent/auth.json` by hand:

```json
{
  "ollama-cloud": {
    "type": "api_key",
    "key": "your-key"
  }
}
```

### 3. Configure the extension (optional)

Extension settings can be set via JSON config files. Project-local settings override global/user-level settings.

| Location | Scope |
|---|---|
| `~/.pi/agent/ollama-cloud.json` | Global / user-level (all projects) |
| `.pi/ollama-cloud.json` | Project-local (takes precedence) |

**Available settings:**

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `webTools` | boolean | `true` | Set to `false` to prevent `ollama_web_search` and `ollama_web_fetch` from being registered |
| `usageStatus` | boolean | `false` | Set to `true` to show the footer usage status bar (opt-in; enable at runtime with `/ollama-usage-status`) |
| `maxRequestBytes` | number | `14680064` (14 MiB) | Request-body budget in bytes. When a request body exceeds it, the oldest inline images are replaced with placeholder text until it fits. Values above Ollama's 16 MiB hard limit are clamped. |

Example `ollama-cloud.json`:

```json
{
  "webTools": false,
  "usageStatus": true,
  "maxRequestBytes": 12582912
}
```

The `PI_OLLAMA_WEB_TOOLS` environment variable still works as an override above config files. Set it to `0`, `false`, `no`, or `off` to disable web tools regardless of config file settings.

### 4. Select a model

Use `/model` or `Ctrl+L` to switch to an Ollama Cloud model. Models appear under the `ollama-cloud` provider.

## How it works

The plugin uses two Ollama Cloud API endpoints to build the model list:

1. **`GET https://ollama.com/v1/models`** - Returns a list of all available model IDs.
2. **`POST https://ollama.com/api/show`** - For each model, fetches details including capabilities (`tools`, `thinking`, `vision`) and context length.

Only models with the `tools` capability are registered - these are the ones Pi can use for tool-calling.

The model list refreshes automatically: pi calls the extension's `refreshModels` callback on startup, when `/model` opens, and on `pi update --models`, fetching the live catalog and persisting it through pi's own model store. A model removed from the Ollama Cloud API disappears after the next successful refresh. The baked-in `models.generated.ts` list (regenerated via `npm run generate-models`) is only a first-launch fallback when no persisted catalog exists yet.

The model fetch itself is keyless (the `/v1/models` and `/api/show` endpoints are public), but pi only runs the live refresh when a credential resolves, so a user without a configured API key stays on the baked-in list until they add one. That is a non-issue in practice because a credentialless user cannot run models anyway.

Model metadata is derived from the `/api/show` response:

| Field | Source |
|---|---|
| `reasoning` | `capabilities` includes `"thinking"` |
| `thinkingLevelMap` | [`thinking-levels.ts`](thinking-levels.ts) + [`reasoning.generated.ts`](reasoning.generated.ts) (models.dev reasoning options), with an `off` override table for models that ignore `none` |
| `input` | `["text", "image"]` if `capabilities` includes `"vision"`, else `["text"]` |
| `contextWindow` | `model_info.*.context_length` (falls back to 128000) |
| `maxTokens` | Probed per-model limits from [`limits.generated.ts`](limits.generated.ts), generated by `scripts/generate-limits.ts` (requires `OLLAMA_API_KEY`). Models without a probed limit fall back to 32768. |
| `cost` | Official per-1M-token prices from the [ollama.com/pricing](https://ollama.com/pricing) model table, generated by `scripts/generate-pricing.ts` into `pricing.generated.ts`. Ollama Cloud is subscription-billed, so these are equivalent pay-as-you-go rates, not actual charges. Catalog IDs with no matching pricing row default to zero. Prices are pinned to the installed package version and only update on a new release, so newly added models register with zero cost until then. |

The per-model max output token table (`limits.generated.ts`) is probed against the live API by `scripts/generate-limits.ts`, since `/api/show` does not expose the limit. It needs an API key: `OLLAMA_API_KEY=<key> npm run generate-limits`. Limits ship with the package, so regenerated values take effect on the next release.

The API itself returns no cost data: completion responses report only token counts (`prompt_tokens`/`completion_tokens`/`total_tokens`, including the final usage chunk when streaming), and `/api/show` exposes no pricing fields. The prices above come from the static `/pricing` page table and are only as fresh as the last regeneration.

Cache pricing is informational only: the `/pricing` page lists a "Cached input" column, but the completion API does not report cache token usage (there is no `prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens` or equivalent in any response, verified against the live API in September 2026), so pi never sees cache hits and `/cost` estimates do not reflect them. `cacheWrite` is always zero because the pricing table has no cache-write column.

### Request-body size limit

Ollama Cloud rejects any request body larger than 16 MiB before parsing it, returning `400 failed to read request body`. Pi re-sends the whole conversation on every turn, including every inline image, and only bounds a single image (2000x2000, 4.5 MB base64), never the total. A vision session therefore crosses the cap after enough screenshots and then fails on every subsequent turn, even for prompts that add no new image.

To keep those sessions working, the extension runs a `before_provider_request` hook that measures the serialized body and, when it exceeds `maxRequestBytes`, replaces the oldest inline images with `[image omitted: Ollama Cloud request body limit]`. The newest images are kept, since a vision turn usually refers to the most recent screenshot. The default budget is 14 MiB, leaving room for headers and JSON escaping below the 16 MiB cap; raise or lower it with `maxRequestBytes` in `ollama-cloud.json`. The session itself is not modified, so the images remain in history and in pi's `/context` accounting - only the outgoing request is trimmed.

### Thinking level mapping

Pi's thinking levels are mapped to Ollama Cloud's OpenAI-compatible `reasoning_effort` parameter in [`thinking-levels.ts`](thinking-levels.ts). The API accepts `none`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, and `max`. Effects of `max` over `high` vary by model and prompt difficulty.

Per-model support is sourced from models.dev: [`scripts/generate-reasoning.ts`](scripts/generate-reasoning.ts) fetches the `ollama-cloud` provider's `reasoning_options` into `reasoning.generated.ts`, and `resolve()` maps each model's effort values onto Pi's levels. Models with `effort` values expose those grades; `toggle`-only models expose a single on/off level. Models with no models.dev entry fall back to `DEFAULT`.

Because the API reports only a boolean `thinking` capability and models.dev does not reliably encode the `none` behavior, the `off` switch is handled via a small override table in `thinking-levels.ts`: it defaults to enabled, and is hidden only for models verified (by live probing) not to honor `reasoning_effort:"none"` - currently `gpt-oss:20b`, `gpt-oss:120b`, and `minimax-m2.7`. The per-model metadata gaps behind the models.dev sourcing are tracked upstream in [ollama/ollama#18385](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/issues/18385).

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `ollama_web_search` | Search the web via Ollama Cloud's `/api/web_search` |
| `ollama_web_fetch` | Fetch a web page via Ollama Cloud's `/api/web_fetch` |

Both tools use the same Ollama Cloud API key configured for the provider. No local Ollama server is needed.

### Caching

Both tools cache results on disk (under the pi agent home, `~/.pi/agent/cache/pi-ollama-cloud/cache.json`). A repeated search query or page fetch within the TTL is served from cache and costs 0 API calls:

- Successful searches and pages: cached for 24h
- Failed page fetches: negative-cached for 15 min, so retrying a dead page does not re-call the API. Auth (401/403), rate-limit (429), transport (timeouts, aborts, network errors), and server (5xx) failures are not cached — fixing the key, waiting out the limit, or a transient blip lets a retry through immediately
- Expired entries are pruned on write and the cache is capped at 500 entries per kind (searches/pages), evicting the oldest first. This bounds entry count, not file size: full page and search content can still make `cache.json` large, and loading it parses the whole file
- The cache file is written with `0600` permissions. It stores full page content and raw URLs, which can embed credentials in query strings — avoid fetching URLs that carry secrets in the query string, or set a custom `PI_OLLAMA_SEARCH_CACHE_PATH`
- Concurrent pi processes share the cache file on a last-writer-wins basis (no cross-process locking): one process's save can drop another's fresh entries, at the cost of a redundant API call
- `refresh=true` on either tool bypasses the cache (including a cached failure) and re-calls the API; the fresh result replaces the cache entry

### `ollama_web_search`

Returns up to 5 results by default (`max_results`, max 10; title, URL, 500-char snippet). Snippets are marked `[truncated]` when the source is longer than the snippet. Output ends with `# live query` or `# from cache` to show whether the API was called.

The search API returns each result's full content; it is cached in full, so a truncated result can be expanded without a separate fetch:

- `expand=<index>` — return the full content of that result (1-based) from the cached search, 0 extra API calls. The cache key includes `max_results`, so expanding hits the cache only when the query was searched with the same `max_results`; otherwise the search runs live first.
- Use `ollama_web_fetch` only when the search result's content is not enough (e.g. you need a different page, or the search excerpt is shorter than the full page).

### `ollama_web_fetch`

Returns the page title, a 3000-char slice of the content, and links. Long pages are read in chunks to keep the context window small:

- `offset=N` — continue reading from character N (the output tells you the next offset)
- `full=true` — return all remaining content from `offset` in one call

A failed fetch throws a diagnostic message (likely cause + next steps) instead of a bare error.

### Tuning

| Env var | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `PI_OLLAMA_SEARCH_TTL_HOURS` | `24` | Success cache TTL |
| `PI_OLLAMA_SEARCH_FAIL_TTL_MINUTES` | `15` | Failure (negative) cache TTL |
| `PI_OLLAMA_SEARCH_CACHE_PATH` | `<pi agent home>/cache/pi-ollama-cloud/cache.json` | Cache file location |
| `PI_OLLAMA_SEARCH_MAX_ENTRIES` | `500` | Max cached entries per kind (searches/pages); oldest evicted beyond the cap |
| `PI_OLLAMA_SEARCH_SNIPPET_CHARS` | `500` | Search snippet length |
| `PI_OLLAMA_SEARCH_CHUNK_CHARS` | `3000` | Fetch chunk size |

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/ollama-webtools [on\|off\|enable\|disable]` | Enable or disable the `ollama_web_search` and `ollama_web_fetch` tools. Toggles if no argument given. |
| `/ollama-cloud-usage` | Show Ollama Cloud usage limits (one section per limit bucket the API reports), per-model request counts, and the 4-week activity cost. |
| `/ollama-usage-status [on\|off\|enable\|disable]` | Enable or disable the footer usage status bar. Toggles if no argument given. |

## Usage status bar

While an `ollama-cloud` model is the active provider, the footer shows a compact
live usage readout with one segment per limit bucket the API reports
(`5h ▕███░░░░░░░▏ 34% 7d ▕█░░░░░░░░░▏ 7%`, or a single `30d` segment) that
refreshes every 5 minutes and after each agent turn (but no more often than every 5 minutes). It is colored by how close
it is to the cap: green below 60%, yellow at 60-79%, red at 80%+. It reads the
same undocumented `/api/usage` endpoint as `/ollama-cloud-usage` and clears
itself on transient errors or when you switch to a non-Ollama-Cloud provider.

It is off by default. Enable it at runtime with `/ollama-usage-status on`, or
enable it by default with `"usageStatus": true` in `ollama-cloud.json`. If the
bar never appears after enabling, run `/ollama-cloud-usage` to see the
underlying error (e.g. a misconfigured API key).

The quota-bar concept is inspired by
[`@entelligentsia/pi-ollama-cloud-usage-tracker`](https://github.com/Entelligentsia/pi-ollama-cloud-usage-tracker),
but this extension fetches usage from the `/api/usage` endpoint with the API key
it already resolves, rather than scraping the settings page with Chrome cookies.

## Usage API for custom status bars

The usage data plane is exported so you can plug it into your own footer or
status bar instead of (or alongside) the built-in one. The relevant modules ship
with the package and are importable directly:

```ts
import { fetchUsage, formatUsage, formatUsageStatusColored } from "pi-ollama-cloud/usage.ts";
import { getCloudApiKey } from "pi-ollama-cloud/utils.ts";
import type { UsageData } from "pi-ollama-cloud/usage.ts";
```

| Export | Description |
|---|---|
| `fetchUsage(apiKey, signal?)` | Fetch the raw `/api/usage` data, returning a typed `UsageData`. Throws a status-mapped error on 401/403/429/404/5xx. |
| `formatUsageStatusColored(theme, data)` | One-line status string with quota bars, colored by usage level. Takes a `Theme` (e.g. `ctx.ui.theme`). |
| `formatUsage(data)` | Multi-line human-readable output (percentages, per-model request counts, activity cost). |
| `getCloudApiKey(ctx)` | Resolve the Ollama Cloud API key the same way the extension does. |
| `isUsageResponse(data)` / `isUsageLimit(data)` | Validators for parsing the raw response yourself. |

Example custom status bar:

```ts
const apiKey = await getCloudApiKey(ctx);
const data = await fetchUsage(apiKey);
ctx.ui.setStatus("my-usage", formatUsageStatusColored(ctx.ui.theme, data));
```

Note that the package ships raw TypeScript sources (no build step), so submodule
imports use the `.ts` extension, matching how the extension imports internally.

## Development

```bash
npm install          # install devDependencies
npm run check        # lint + format + type-check (auto-fix)
npm run lint         # lint only (no fixes)
npm run typecheck    # type-check only (tsgo --noEmit)
npm run format       # format only
OLLAMA_API_KEY=<key> npm run generate-limits   # probe max output tokens (writes limits.generated.ts)
```

The project uses [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for linting and formatting (2-space indent, line width 120) and [tsgo](https://github.com/microsoft/typescript-go) for type-checking.

### Testing local changes

Static checks (no API key needed):

```bash
npm install
npm run check        # lint + format + type-check
npm run test         # unit tests
```

Live smoke against the real API (needs an `OLLAMA_API_KEY` or an `ollama-cloud` entry in `auth.json`):

```bash
# Run pi with the local extension, no install required. The --no-* flags isolate
# the run from other installed extensions, skills, prompt templates, themes,
# context files, and session storage so only the local checkout is exercised
pi --no-extensions --no-skills --no-prompt-templates --no-themes --no-context-files --no-session \
  -e ./index.ts --model "ollama-cloud/gemma4:31b" --no-tools -p "Say hi in one word"

# Verify thinking is suppressed when off
pi --no-extensions --no-skills --no-prompt-templates --no-themes --no-context-files --no-session \
  -e ./index.ts --thinking off --model "ollama-cloud/glm-5.2" --no-tools --mode json -p 'hi'

# Web tools
npm run smoke:web-tools
```

The `-e`/`--extension` flag loads the extension from the local checkout without installing it; `--no-extensions` disables all other extension discovery so the run cannot pick up an installed `pi-ollama-cloud` or other plugins. The same commands run in CI (`.github/workflows/test.yml`), gated on the `OLLAMA_CLOUD_API_KEY` secret.

## How is this different from `ollama launch pi`?

[`ollama launch pi`](https://docs.ollama.com/integrations/pi) is Ollama's built-in one-command setup that configures Pi to talk to your **local Ollama server**. Both local and cloud models work - cloud models (e.g. `qwen3.5:cloud`) are proxied through your local server to `ollama.com`. This extension takes a different approach: it connects Pi **directly** to Ollama's hosted API at `ollama.com`, bypassing the local server entirely.

| | `ollama launch pi` | `pi-ollama-cloud` |
|---|---|---|
| **Provider name** | `ollama` | `ollama-cloud` |
| **Endpoint** | Local Ollama server (`http://localhost:11434/v1`) | Ollama Cloud (`https://ollama.com/v1`) |
| **Local models** | ✅ Run on your machine | ❌ Not available |
| **Cloud models** | ✅ Proxied through local server (e.g. `qwen3.5:cloud`) | ✅ Connected directly |
| **Local Ollama required?** | Yes - must be installed and running | No - works without any local server |
| **Authentication** | Handled by the local server (sign-in flow via `ollama`) | Ollama Cloud API key (set via `OLLAMA_API_KEY` or `auth.json`) |
| **Model discovery** | Interactive picker with curated recommendations + pulled models | Dynamic - fetches all available cloud models with tool support from the API |
| **Web tools** | Auto-installed (`@ollama/pi-web-search`) when cloud is enabled | ✅ Built-in: `ollama_web_search` and `ollama_web_fetch` use the [Ollama Cloud web search API](https://docs.ollama.com/capabilities/web-search) directly (same API key, no local server needed) |
| **Setup effort** | One command: `ollama launch pi` | Install extension + API key |
| **Use when** | You're already running Ollama locally and want the default experience | You don't want to run a local server, or want a standalone cloud-only provider alongside your local setup |

**You can use both at the same time.** The providers live under different names (`ollama` vs `ollama-cloud`), so you can switch between them with `/model` or `Ctrl+L`. For example, use your local `ollama` provider for low-latency work on smaller models, and `ollama-cloud` for direct access to the full catalog of cloud models without needing a local server.

> **Note:** The [`@ollama/pi-web-search`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ollama/pi-web-search) package (installed automatically by `ollama launch pi`) calls the **local** Ollama server's `/api/experimental/web_search` and `/api/experimental/web_fetch` endpoints and authenticates via `ollama signin`. This extension's `ollama_web_search` and `ollama_web_fetch` tools use the **cloud** API at `ollama.com/api/web_search` and `ollama.com/api/web_fetch` instead - same API key, no local server required. Both can coexist: the local tools register as `web_search`/`web_fetch` and these register as `ollama_web_search`/`ollama_web_fetch` to avoid name conflicts.

## Releasing

Publishing a new version to npm is a two-command process:

```bash
# 1. Bump version and create a git tag in one step
npm version minor   # or patch, or major
# 2. Push the tag to trigger the GitHub Actions publish workflow
git push --tags
```

Because the model catalog refreshes automatically at runtime, a release is **not** needed to ship new models. Publish only when:

- A model is retired and still listed by the API: add it to `RETIRED_MODEL_IDS` in `scripts/generate-models.ts` (check https://docs.ollama.com/cloud#retirements, then regenerate `models.generated.ts`).
- Pricing changes: Ollama updates the model pricing table, or a new model needs a pricing row (regenerate `pricing.generated.ts`).
- Max output token limits changed: run `OLLAMA_API_KEY=<key> npm run generate-limits` locally and commit.

The tag version must match the version in `package.json` - `npm version` handles this automatically. The workflow at `.github/workflows/publish.yml` verifies the match before publishing to npm.

The workflow uses npm's [trusted publishing](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers/) (OIDC) - no tokens stored as secrets. To set it up:

1. Go to [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com) → your avatar → **Packages** → `pi-ollama-cloud` → **Settings** → **Trusted publishing**
2. Click **GitHub Actions** and enter:
   - **Workflow filename**: `publish.yml`
3. Save

Each publish also gets automatic [provenance attestation](https://docs.npmjs.com/generating-provenance-statements).

## Upgrading

Since 0.8.0:

- The `/ollama-cloud-refresh` command is removed. Models refresh automatically on startup, `/model` open, and `pi update --models`.
- The old cache file at `~/.pi/agent/cache/ollama-cloud-models.json` is orphaned. Delete it manually: `rm ~/.pi/agent/cache/ollama-cloud-models.json`.
- Requires a pi version with the native `refreshModels` API (pi 0.84.0+).

## Notes

- The fetch timeout is 10 seconds per request. On slow connections, some model detail fetches may time out; the refresh uses whatever succeeded and only fails if every model detail fetch fails.
- `deepseek-v4` occasionally emits raw `<｜DSML｜tool_calls｜>` markup as plain text instead of structured tool calls, then stops. This is DeepSeek's native tool-call format leaking through Ollama Cloud's OpenAI-compatible endpoint, so it looks like an upstream Ollama issue rather than something this extension can fix. If you hit it, retry or switch models.
